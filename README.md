# js sandbox

## General info
### The whole project is for learning purposes only. Check 'dev' branch for recent pushes.

## Technologies 
html, scss, javascript

## On the less serious note:
This project to me is like a sandbox where I can test my freshly aquired knowledge and further develop my programming skills. Don't judge me to harsh. :)
